Sus efectos se detallan en la página 9. Cartas de Ciudad Las cartas de Ciudad, que son de color negro, son una nueva categoría de cartas. En cada partida se añaden algunas, de manera aleatoria, a los mazos de Era I, II y III. Cartas de Gremio y de Líder Los nuevos Gremios y Líderes se añaden a los ya disponibles. Nota algunas de estas cartas sólo se puede utilizar con esta expansión. Todas las cartas de esta expansión tienen impresa en la parte inferior una máscara, para poder separarlas fácilmente del resto del juego después de jugar. Fichas de Deuda A partir de ahora, las ciudades pueden perder dinero e incluso endeudarse, lo cual se marcará con las fichas de Deuda (-1 PV y -5 PV). Fichas de Diplomacia Las fichas de Diplomacia se utilizan para indicar el nuevo efecto de Diplomacia. Cuadernillo de puntuación En este cuadernillo hay una casilla nueva, para anotar los puntos obtenidos por las cartas de Ciu - dad, así como para anotar las puntuaciones por equipos. Preparación Añade a cada uno de los mazos de Era tantas cartas negras (de la Era correspondiente) como jugadores seáis. Aclaración estas cartas se eligen al azar y se incluyen en los mazos sin mirarlas. Las cartas restantes se dejan apar - te, boca abajo, ya que no se utilizarán en esta partida. Los nuevos Gremios se suman a los anteriores, aunque el número de Gremios por partida se mantiene (número de Gremios número de jugadores 2). Las fichas de Deuda y de Diplomacia se colocan en el centro de la mesa, con las monedas y los marcadores de Conflicto. Ejemplo César está preparando una partida a 6 jugadores. Ha retirado las cartas 7 de la partida. Luego, elige al azar 6 cartas de Ciudad de la Era I, 6 de la Era II y 6 de la Era III, y las añade a los mazos correspondientes. Además, añade 8 Gremios al mazo de Era III. - 4 -Resumen de la partida Al inicio de cada Era, cada uno de los jugadores tendrá una mano de 8 cartas (en lugar de 7, como en el juego básico). En cada Era, los jugadores, por lo tanto, contarán con una carta extra. Las demás normas relativas al procedimiento de juego permanecen sin cambios. Los efectos de las nuevas cartas se detallan en las páginas siguientes. Sin embargo hay dos nuevas mecánicas que requieren de una explicación más detallada la deuda y la diplomacia. Deudas Una carta con el símbolo provoca una pérdida de monedas de todos los adversarios del jugador que ha puesto la carta en juego. Cada oponente deberá abonar el importe correspondiente a la banca, o deberá coger una ficha de Deuda por cada moneda que no haya pagado. Esto significa que puede haber deudas parciales, cuando un jugador paga, por un lado, una parte de la deuda en monedas y recibe, por otro lado, fichas de Deuda por el resto de monedas sin pagar. Al final de la partida, cada ficha de Deuda resta puntos de victoria (PV) al jugador que las posee. Aclaración - El jugador que pone en juego una carta de pérdida de dinero, no se ve afectado por dicha carta. - Las monedas perdidas por los jugadores van a parar a la banca. - Las deudas contraídas no puede ser canceladas. Importante las pérdidas de dinero se resuelven siempre al final de un turno, después de que los jugadores hayan jugado sus cartas, y por lo tanto, gastado sus monedas mercadeando, o por el contrario, ganado oro para pagar... Ejemplo César juega un Guarida (Lair). Cada jugador debe pagar 2 monedas al final del turno. David decide pagar las 2 monedas, que son entregadas a la banca. Alfonso tiene una sola moneda en sus arcas, pero decide pagar para obtener una sola ficha de Deuda. Mariano, por su parte, tiene monedas, pero decide guardarlas para más adelante; por lo tanto, recibe dos fichas de Deuda.

JUEGO LIMPIO Lo adecuado es anunciar a tus oponentes que estás cogiendo una ficha de Diplomacia, a fin de evitar sorpresas en la próxima fase de Conflicto. Dicho jugador, no tomará parte en la resolución de la siguiente fase de Conflicto, tras la cual debe devolver la ficha de Diplomacia a la banca. El jugador se considera ausente durante la resolución de la fase, por lo que no recibirá ningún marcador de Conflicto (ni de victoria ni de derrota). Las ciudades vecinas a dicho jugador se considerarán adyacentes (para la fase de Conflicto de este turno solamente) y enfrentarán a sus milicias, de acuerdo a las normas habituales. Ejemplo Durante la Era I, Mariano juega una Residencia (Residence). Al final de esta Era, Mariano no tomará parte en la Resolución del Conflicto, por lo que sus dos vecinos, Alfonso y César, medirán sus fuerzas militares, como si sus ciudades fueran vecinas. Aclaraciones - U n jugador puede obtener varias fichas de Diplomacia, pero DEBE descartar una en cada fase de Resolución de Conflictos. - U n jugador con una ficha de Diplomacia está OBLIGADO a jugarla durante la siguiente fase de Reso - lución de Conflictos (incluso si ese jugador es militarmente más fuerte que los jugadores vecinos). Si solamente hay dos jugadores implicados en una fase de Resolución de Con - flictos, se enfrentan entre sí una sola vez, por lo que ganarán marcadores de Conflicto una sola vez. Ejemplo Durante la fase de Resolución de Conflictos de la Era II, César, Ainhoa, David y Andrés no participan (cada uno de ellos pierde una ficha de Diplomacia anteriormente adquirida). A Mariano no le quedan más fichas de Diplomacia, por lo que entra en guerra. Mariano y Alfonso comparan sus milicias, de acuerdo con las normas habituales. Mariano gana, pero solamente se lleva un marcador de Victoria, ya que solamente tenía un rival durante esta fase. Fin de la partida Al igual que en el juego básico, la partida termina tras la fase de Resolución de Conflictos de la Era III. Cada jugador suma los puntos de su civilización, y el jugador con más puntos será el ganador. Consejos - P ara una mayor comodidad a la hora de calcular los puntos, resta las fichas de Deuda a las monedas y anota el resul - tado en la casilla monedas de la hoja de puntuación. - L os puntos de las cartas negras se suman junto con los de las cartas blancas (Líderes). Ejemplo César termina la partida con 3 fichas de Deuda. Como tiene 5 monedas (1 punto), anota -2 puntos (1 punto de monedas - 3 puntos de deuda) en su casilla monedas. - 6 -Descripción de las cartas PIGEON LOFT, SPY RING, TORTURE CHAMBER Estas tres cartas contienen un símbolo . Al final de la partida, cada máscara te permite copiar el símbolo científico de una carta verde presente en una de las dos ciuda - des vecinas. Aclaraciones - Si un jugador posee varios símbolos , solamente puede copiar una carta determina - da una sola vez, lo que significa que debe copiar tantas cartas diferentes como símbolos tenga. - Es posible copiar el símbolo de una carta, in - cluso si el jugador tiene una copia de dicha carta en su propia ciudad. - Un jugador puede copiar dos cartas idénticas (si tiene suficientes máscaras) si las dos ciuda - des vecinas poseen la misma carta (por ejem - plo puede copiar de un Taller (Workshop) de la ciudad de la izquierda y un segundo Taller de la ciudad de la derecha. Ejemplo Al final de la partida, Ainhoa tiene 2 cartas con el símbolo . El jugador de su izquierda sólo tiene una carta verde, con el símbolo del compás. El jugador de su derecha, no tiene cartas verdes. Por lo tanto el primer de Ainhoa cuenta como un , pero el segundo es inútil ya que no hay más símbolos que poder copiar. Si el jugador de la izquierda hubiera tenido 2 cartas verdes con un símbolo cada una, las dos máscaras de Ainhoa podrían haber contado como . GAMBLING DEN El jugador recibe 6 monedas de la banca. Sus dos vecinos reciben también 1 moneda de la banca.MILITIA, MERCENARIES, CONTINGENT Estas tres cartas ofrecen más Escudos que las cartas rojas de la Era correspondiente (235 Escudos respectivamente).

Los compañeros de equipo deben sentarse uno junto al otro. Resumen de una Era Durante la partida, los compañeros de equipo pueden comunicarse libremente entre sí y mostrarse las cartas de sus manos (incluidas las cartas de Líder si estáis usando dicha expansión). Un jugador debe utilizar sus propios recursos antes de comprar uno a sus vecinos. Se prohíbe a los compañeros de equipo - Compartir monedas,- Cambiarse cartas, - El comercio gratuito entre ellos,- Comprarse recursos el uno al otro para poner en juego edificios que se pueden conseguir mediante una construcción en cadena. Cuando un jugador pone en juego una carta que provoca una pérdida de dinero, su compañero de equipo también tiene que pagar esa pérdida. En el juego por equipos, la fase de Resolución de Conflictos y la Diplomacia se juegan de forma distinta. Resolución de Conflictos por equipos. En el juego por equipos, no hay enfrentamientos entre dos jugadores de un mismo equipo. Por lo que cada jugador se enfrenta solamente a la ciudad enemiga adyacente a la suya.

El uso de la ficha de Diplomacia es obligatorio, y una vez jugada, se desecha. Aclaraciones - El uso de una ficha de Diplomacia por un jugador no afecta a su compañero de equipo. - Es posible que un jugador gane un conflicto, incluso si el jugador ha jugado una ficha de Diplomacia. - Si los 2 miembros de un equipo han jugado una ficha de Diplomacia, cada uno de ellos recibe una sola ficha de Conflicto, así como sus oponentes. Ejemplo Alfonso y Mariano son compañeros de equipo. Durante la fase de Resolución de Conflic - tos de la Era III, Alfonso utiliza una ficha de Diplomacia.

              "['Originally posted as a video review with extended final thoughts on our Rolls in the Family YouTube channel Video Review Overview 7 Wonders is a card-drafting civilization game that will have you selecting cards over 3 ages to build your unique Wonder, invest in science and infrastructure, and war with your neighboring opponents. All turns are performed simultaneously, with each player selecting a card from their current hand to play, and then passing the remaining cards to the next player. Once all but the last card in each hand have been drafted, the Age ends and you compare your military power to the players on your left and right, distributing victory points based on the results. New hands are dealt at the beginning of each Age, and after 3 Ages the players will tally their final scores.',\n",
              " 'Game Feel Each time you select a card in 7 Wonders, you can decide to play it for its effect, use it to build a stage of your wonder, or discard it for 3 coins. Many cards require you to have the matching resources to play, so collecting resource production cards is important for having more playable options. However, you can also pay either of your neighbors two coins to use one of their resource icons, and some cards can also be played for free if you have the prerequisite card from the preceding Age. You are constantly faced with decisions like, Do I take this card that immediately benefits me, or take this other card that will give me the potential of stronger options later? If you can acquire a lot of money, you may be able to get away with fewer of your own resource cards. But be careful, if neither you nor your neighbors have a specific resource going into the late game, you may be locked out of playing any cards that require it. If you want to gain the powerful benefits from building your unique wonder, you know that, multiple times during the game, you will need to pass on the options in your hand to play a card face down. But when is the right time? Do you push your luck that a future hand will have worse options than your current hand? While most of what your opponents are doing does not affect you directly, the sharing of resources, military battles, and overall strategies of your two neighbors give you plenty of reasons to keep an eye on what they are doing and take those variables into account whenever you select a card. Especially with abilities like the green technology cards that can multiply to huge totals if a player collects a lot of them, you dont want to be the player that kept passing your neighbor the perfect cards for them to amass a ridiculous amount of points. FAQ',\n",
              " 'Player Counts - 7 Wonders plays well across a wide variety of player counts, mainly because of its use of simultaneous card drafting. There is a 2-player variant which we cant recommend directly, though some people seem to enjoy it. And if you pick up the Cities expansion, it pushes the game to 8 players which still works great. Abstract vs. Thematic - The asymmetric wonders and use of resources to build cards help to reinforce the civilization theme, but the theme definitely fades into the background as you start thinking about the card effects and which ones to keep. Luck vs. Skill - There is a nice balance of luck and skill here. While the hands of cards are randomized, your strategy is constantly informed by the cards that you and your opponents are playing. However, the card drafting causes the skill in the game to lean more towards repeated tactical decisions than long-term strategy. Multiplayer Solitaire vs. Highly Interactive - The core mechanisms dont sound particularly interactive as each player is working on their own tableau, but the strategies of others, and especially your neighbors, really have a lot of influence on how you approach your own decisions. Short Setup vs. Long Setup - It is a fairly easy game to set up, with the main chore being removing cards from the decks to configure them for your specific player count. But then you can just deal hands and get playing. Easy to Teach vs. Hard to Teach - While 7 Wonders is relatively easy to teach as far as strategy games go, we think it is trickier to teach well than it often gets credit for. Players need to understand all the card types and how resources and prerequisites work, and the hidden, simultaneous card drafting means that it is a little harder for experienced players to help out new players that may be confused by their options. Low Setup Variability vs. High Setup Variability - Each player getting a unique wonder and dealing unique hands gives this nice setup variability, though the deck for a player count will always be the same outside of some of the purple guild cards that are randomized in the Age 3 deck. Things to Like Every Turn Is an Interesting Decision - One of the great things about card drafting is you are constantly given a choice among several good options, and every time you receive a new hand from your neighbor, it is a new puzzle figuring out which of those cards serve you best. The interest of the decision is amplified by some cards helping now versus others, such as resources, investing in the future, as well as the fact that you want to make sure you arent passing the next player something too good. Almost No Downtime - The other great thing about card drafting is that turns are performed simultaneously, and you are rarely waiting long for the next interesting decision. This comes at the expense of some direct player interaction but is still a huge strength as it allows everyone at the table to have a satisfying strategic experience with a game length that remains short even with larger player counts. Great Ratio of Depth to Game Length - And it is really the combination of those interesting decisions and quick play time that give 7 Wonders an outstanding ratio of depth to game length. For a larger group that is still looking for a more strategic experience, 7 Wonders gives them great bang for their buck. Variety of Strategic Routes - And the game remains interesting after many plays, largely because there is a lot of room for your strategy to play out differently. There are some extreme strategies such as spamming blue point cards, green technologies, or dominating military battles, but there are also any number of hybrid strategies that could be victorious. If you want to play well, you really need to be willing to adapt to the cards you receive, the decisions your neighboring opponents make, and the opportunities afforded by your unique Wonder.',\n",
              " 'Things to Dislike Falls into Narrow Niche of Complexity - In our experience, 7 Wonders can fall into kind of a weird in-between category where it can have too much complexity for some less experienced gamers, but can also leave some gamers feeling like it isnt complex enough. As long as you have a group that all fall within those bounds they will likely have a great time, but for a game that can play all the way up to 7 players, the odds go up that at least one person in the group falls outside the target audience and it can make it a little harder to get to the table. Hate Drafting Can Feel Forced - And while keeping an eye on your opponent makes the tactical decisions more interesting, there are also times where you feel you have no choice but to block your opponent from an amazing card, and it can feel less fun giving up a turn to take something that may not be very good for you.',\n",

If you want your interaction to be a little more direct or prefer strategic planning over tactical decisions, 7 Wonders might not be the best choice. But if you want a strategy game that can support higher player counts while still playing quickly, enjoy figuring out the best card out of a hand of options, and like building up your own tableau of cards in front of you, 7 Wonder fits the bill and still holds up after over a decade.

              "'Saltar al contenido Reseña: 7 Wonders Escrito por iMisut 06/02/2013 21 Comentarios Introducción Hoy toca hablar de uno de los juegos que, desde que lo tengo, mas veces ha salido a la mesa. Se trata, nada mas y nada menos que de 7 Wonders, el aclamado y galardonado juego del diseñador francés Antoine Bauza, con las magnificas ilustraciones del también famoso Miguel Coimbra. Portada Entre los muchos galardones acumulados por este titulo, hay que destacar el Kennerspiel des Jahres (Juego del Año para Expertos) dentro de los Spiel des Jahres del 2011, es decir, que tiene suficientes credenciales como para ser un Must Have. ¿Que nos propone 7 Wonders? Pues nada mas y nada menos que ponernos al mando de una de las siete civilizaciones que contruyeron alguna de las siete maravillas del mundo antiguo: los Jardines Colgantes de Babilonia, el Coloso de Rodas, el Templo de Artemisa, el Mausoleo de Halicarnaso, el Faro de Alejandría y la Gran Pirámide de Guiza (la unica maravilla que se mantiene en pie hoy en día). Desde nuestro puesto iremos tomando decisiones que nos hagan prosperar lo suficiente como para construir esa maravilla por la cual nuestra civilización será recordada en los libros de historia. Contraportada Se encuentra publicado en España de la mano de Asmodee (que como es habitual, realiza una localización justita, traduciendo únicamente las normas, dejando las cartas con los nombres en inglés). Es un juego de 2 a 7 personas (gran abanico de posibilidades), con una duración media por partida de una media hora. Importante: si ya conoces el juego y/o sólo te interesa mi opinión sobre el mismo, puedes pasar directamente al apartado de Opinión. Los apartados Contenido y Mecánica están destinados especialmente a aquellos que no conocen el juego y prefieren hacerse una idea general de cómo funciona. Ir a la Opinión Personal Contenido El juego viene en una caja de tamaño estándar de juegos de mesa, con unas dimensiones de 30 cm x 30 cm x 7,5 cm (medidas muy similares a las de cajas de otros juegos como Dominion o Juego de Tronos) con un peso aproximado de unos 900 gr. (lo que nos da una idea de que mucho material no viene dentro de semejante cajaza). El contenido es el siguiente: 7 tableros de Civilización (cartón) 7 cartas Maravilla 49 cartas Era I 49 cartas Era II 49 cartas Era III 42 marcadores de Conflicto (cartón) 20 monedas de valor 3 (cartón) 30 monedas de valor 1 (cartón) 1 libreta para las puntuaciones 1 libro de reglas 2 cartas especiales para el modo “2 jugadores” Contenido Mecánica El concepto de 7 Wonders es muy sencillo a la vez que interesante. Vayamos por partes, primero explicaré el juego de 3 a 7 jugadores, y, posteriormente, comentaré que modificaciones se realizan para poder jugar 2 jugadores. Conceptos Básicos Hablemos de los conceptos básicos. En primer lugar tenemos las Cartas de, que simbolizan las posibles construcciones que podremos levantar en nuestra civilización. Hay 7 tipos de construcciones, que a la postre darán todas puntos de victoria de alguna manera: Cartas de Recursos Naturales (Marrones) Cartas de Recursos Elaborados (Grises) Cartas de Construcciones Científicas (Verdes) Cartas de Construcciones Económicas (Amarillas) Cartas de Construcciones Bélicas (Rojas) Cartas de Construcciones Ornamentales (Azules) Cartas de Construcciones de Gremios (Moradas) En el borde superior izquierdo de la carta se indica el coste de construcción, o bien la construcción de la Era anterior que se debe tener para construir dicho elemento sin necesidad de cumplir los requisitos de coste. En nuestro tablero de civilización tendremos dibujada la gran maravilla que aspiramos a construir. Esta tendrá varias fases de construcción, con un coste indicado, que deberemos cumplir para construir dicha fase. Como habréis comprobado, la manera de conseguir recursos es levantando las edificaciones que nos los proporcionen en cada turno. Pero es posible que no tengamos suficientes unidades de determinados elementos a la hora de querer construir un determinado edificio. Esto se soluciona con el comercio con nuestros vecinos (los jugadores adyacentes). En cualquier turno podremos hacer uso de los recursos que generen las civilizaciones vecinas, pagando un coste. Este será, salvo que tengamos algún edificio que diga lo contrario, de dos monedas por unidad de recurso que utilicemos. Nuestros vecinos no podrán negarse a dárnoslos. Monedas Y para finalizar, tendremos los conflictos bélicos que ocurren al final de cada Era. Estos suceden con tus vecinos. Para ello se comparan el numero de escudos que se tienen en los edificios bélicos construidos (los rojos). El que mas escudos tenga gana el conflicto, llevándose los puntos de victoria correspondientes (1 por victoria en la primera era, 3 en la segunda y 5 en la tercera). En el mejor de los casos, por conflictos bélicos se aspira a tener 18 puntos (ganar los 2 conflictos de cada era). Para que seáis capaces de vislumbrar las posibilidades estratégicas del juego: Las construcciones ornamentales (azules) otorgan los puntos de victoria que se indican en la carta Las construcciones científicas (verdes) otorgan puntos según su combinación. Existen 3 símbolos (tablilla de piedra, rueda dentada y compás con regla). Las cartas de cada símbolo da puntos por si solas, otorgando el numero de cartas de cada símbolo al cuadrado (es decir, si tenemos 1 carta de rueda dentada, nos dará 1 punto, si tenemos 2, 4 puntos, si tenemos 3, 9 puntos, etc.). Así con cada uno de los 3 símbolos. Además, cada tripleta de construcciones científicas que tengamos (3 cartas verdes, una con cada uno de los símbolos) nos otorgará 7 puntos. Algunas construcciones económicas (amarillas) dan puntos de victoria (por cada nivel de maravilla construido, por número de construcciones económicas, etc.). También las monedas que nos hayan quedado en tesorería dan puntos (1 punto por cada 3 monedas). Y finalmente las construcciones de gremios (moradas) dan puntos según la condición que indiquen, que normalmente estará relacionada con alguno de los tipos de construcciones disponibles y relacionada con nosotros y nuestros vecinos. Preparación de la Partida En primer lugar, hay que dejar en la caja las cartas que no correspondan al número de jugadores que haya en la partida. A continuación: Se ajusta el numero de cartas necesarios para jugar (en función del numero de jugadores hay mas o menos cartas de era), se barajan y se colocan en 3 mazos. Cada jugador elige una civilización (aquí como cada uno quiera repartirlas, al azar o eligiendo cada uno una) y se decide por que cara del tablero se juega (la cara B es algo mas complicada que la A, pero no modifica la mecánica de juego en absoluto). Se entrega a cada jugador 3 monedas de valor 1. Existe una variante para poder jugar a 2. Se utiliza una civilización neutral, que será controlada alternativamente por cada uno de los dos jugadores, de manera que pueda ir levantando construcciones que puedan interesar a los dos. Desarrollo de la Partida El juego consta de 3 eras. En cada una de las eras se reparten todas las cartas (7 para cada jugador) y comienza el juego. En cada turno, el jugador deberá elegir una carta de su mano para realizar una de las siguientes acciones: Construir dicha carta, cumpliendo la condiciones indicadas en el borde superior izquierdo (como he comentado antes) Construir una parte de la maravilla, usando la carta bocabajo, y pagando el coste indicado en el nivel de la maravilla (vale cualquier carta que tengamos en nuestra mano) Descartar la carta y ganar 3 monedas En el momento de levantar una construcción, puede darse el caso de que no contemos con los recursos necesarios. Es aquí donde aparece el comercio con nuestros vecinos. Y es que podremos comprar los recursos necesarios a estos (y no podrán negarse) pagando 2 monedas por cada unidad que necesitemos (si no tenemos una construcción que modifique este precio), siempre y cuando ellos cuenten con dicho material. Una vez realizada la acción con nuestra carta, pasamos nuestra mano a uno de los jugadores adyacentes (en función de las Eras se rotan las manos en sentido horario o antihorario, viene indicado en el anverso de las cartas). Se van jugando cartas hasta que solo queden manos de 2 cartas, que será el ultimo turno de esa Era. Cuando solo queden 2 cartas, cada jugador elegirá una para realizar su acción y la otra la colocará en la pila de descartes. Y con esto finaliza una era. Solo falta resolver los conflictos y entregar los puntos de victoria correspondientes a cada jugador. Marcadores de Conflicto Fin de la Partida La partida finaliza cuando se jueguen todas las rondas de cada una de las tres eras. Tras eso, realizaremos el recuento final y el ganador será el jugador con mas puntos de victoria. Opinión Personal Nos encontramos ante el Filler (para algunos) del 2011 y que verdaderamente hizo furor. Es una idea magnifica porque coge un concepto bastante común en este tipo de juegos, como es el de tener una mano de posibles construcciones e ir levantándolas en nuestra civilización según convenga, con el de que dicho mano vaya rotando por todos los jugadores, pues es aquí donde aparece la gran novedad estratégica que ofrece 7 Wonders. Por otro lado es un juego que «nos aisla» del resto de jugadores. Es decir, seamos el número de jugadores que seamos, principalmente tendremos que estar pendiente de los dos jugadores adyacentes a nosotros, a nuestra izquierda y a nuestra derecha, pues es con ellos con quienes interactuaremos a lo largo de la partida, negociando y guerreando al final de cada Era. Además, habrá muchas cartas que nos otorgarán privilegios en función de la evolución de nuestros vecinos. Del resto de jugadores habrá que estar pendientes básicamente para ir controlando qué cartas construyen que nos interesaban a nosotros y dejen de estar disponibles en las futuras manos que nos irán llegando. Tableros de Maravilla La separación de las Eras no es casual. Cada Era debe servir para una cosa. La primera Era es claramente de levantamiento de construcciones que den recursos que a la postre nos permitan edificar construcciones mas poderosas. Un buen baremo para guiarnos en esta primera Era es asegurarnos los recursos que nos permitan construir nuestra maravilla. La tercera Era será la de las grandes construcciones (de gran coste de recursos en cantidad y diversidad). La segunda Era es algo intermedio entre la primera y la segunda. También comentar que completar la maravilla no es condición indispensable para ganar la partida, aunque si otorga muchísimos puntos en el recuento final. Pero hay maravillas que otorgan privilegios, que, en función de la estrategia que hayamos decidido tomar, puede que no nos interese completar. Según mi experiencia, el número mínimo ideal para jugar a 7 Wonders es 4 jugadores, pues con 4 jugadores ya hay aislamiento, es decir, hay jugadores que no están adyacentes entre si, provocando que haya recursos que no estén accesibles a todos, que es uno de los grandes problemas al que se enfrentan los jugadores en 7 Wonders, que no es otro que planificar que recursos interesa que tengamos nosotros en nuestra civilización y cuales «esperamos» que vayan a tener los demás. Obviamente, gastar un turno en levantar una construcción que nos proporcione recursos duele un poco, pues parece que no estamos obteniendo nada que a la postre nos dé puntos de victoria. Pero a medida que la partida avance, sobre todo si son recursos que solo tenemos nosotros, serán una fuente de ingresos gracias al comercio con nuestros vecinos, que necesitarán ese preciado recurso que solo tenemos nosotros. Además, también es muy interesante ver como ocurren reacciones en cadena. Esto ocurre normalmente con las construcciones bélicas. En el momento que un jugador construye su primera construcción bélica… salta la liebre. Los jugadores adyacente intentarán construir para defenderse, lo que provocará que los adyacentes a estos también intenten defenderse. Cartas de Era Existe cierto componente de fastidio a los rivales (además de los conflictos bélicos) pues, como para levantar las distintas fases de nuestra maravilla o conseguir monedas mediante el descarte no importa que carta usemos, los jugadores intentarán sacar de la partida construcciones que beneficien al resto de jugadores pero que a nosotros no nos aporten gran cosa. Es un juego donde es indispensable la capacidad de adaptación y estar pendiente de lo que hacen los demás para utilizarlo en beneficio propio. De nada sirve centrarse en la propia civilización, pues seguramente el resto de jugadores se encargarán de evitar que prosperemos si nuestros planes son claros como el agua. Los materiales están bastante bien. El cartón de los tableros y los marcadores es de un grosor suficiente como para que el juego soporte el paso del tiempo sin muchos problemas. Las cartas son ENORMES, lo que permiten admirar en todo su esplendor las ilustraciones de Miguel Coimbra. Pero como siempre, la perfección no existe. ¿Cuales son los lunares de este, por otro lado, juegazo? Como he dicho al principio, en mi opinión no deja de ser un Filler. Uno de los mejores Fillers que he jugado. Pero un Filler a fin de cuentas. Una vez que los jugadores saben jugar, las partidas duran lo que se indica en la caja, en torno a la media hora. Y aunque el juego permita multitud de posibilidades tácticas, las decisiones que se van tomando a lo largo de la partida suelen ser similares en todas, por lo que el juego se quema bastante rápido y vuelve a tardar en salir. Tipos de Cartas Además, es un juego de cartas (con algunos marcadores de cartón y los tableros) por el que hay que desembolsar casi 35 € (mas el desembolso en las fundas para proteger las cartas), por lo que en mi opinión, es un juego caro, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta eso, que es posible quemarlo bastante rápido y que tarde en volver a salir a la mesa. Pero no deja de ser un señor juego que no debería faltar en ninguna ludoteca. Por todo esto le doy un… Me gusta esto: Cargando...

SIGUIENTE Partida: Agricola (11/02/2013) 21 comentarios Neiban dice: 07/02/2013 a las 00:29 Buenas Iván. No conocía tu blog, así que te añado a mi blogroll. Buena reseña del 7Wonder. Es cierto que jugándose mucho se puede quemar bastante, pero… ¿no le pasa esto a casi todo filler? Saludos! Responder iMisut dice: 07/02/2013 a las 07:34 Como bien dices, todo Filler es susceptible de quemarse saliendo mucho a la mesa. Pero al 7 Wonders ademas le noto que aun es mas fácil quemarlo. Yo siento que acabas jugando muy parecido todas las partidas. Hay pocas opciones de variación. Responder Javier Torres dice: 03/02/2014 a las 09:18 Gran reseña. Yo solo puedo jugar con mi hija y mi mujer, y aunque sea a 3, nos gusta bastante, pero es lo que dices; se esta empezando a quemar. Crees que con las expansiones ganará el juego en algo y será menos monótono? Enhorabuena por el blog y por tus aportaciones en AP Podcast. Un saludo. Responder iMisut dice: 03/02/2014 a las 09:29 Buenas Javier! Ante todo gracias por pasarte y por la enhorabuena. Hombre, ante todo decirte que yo no tengo ninguna de las dos expansiones. Ambas valen aproximadamente lo mismo (casi 20 €). Por ese precio puedes casi comprarte un juego nuevo, de lo que yo soy partidario antes de expandir uno que ya se tiene. Pero segun he leido, la expansión mas interesante es la segunda, Cities. Es la que añade mas conceptos y mas variedad al juego. La de Leaders es prescindible. Ya te digo, segun lo que he leido. Así que mi consejo: si te vas a comprar un juego nuevo, por el mismo precio puedes pillarte el Santiago de Cuba y tienes algo distinto. Si estás decidido a ampliar el 7 Wonders, pues Cities. Un saludo! Miguel Angel Cabaleiro Fernandez dice: 29/04/2015 a las 08:46 Buenas Iván: Pues yo la verdad es que le tengo muchas ganas a este juego. Gran parte de mis amigos juegan al 7 wonders y próximamente vamos a organizar una liguilla con emparejamientos semanales, con la premisa de que cada semana se juegue a un juego diferente (en plan, si somos 8 los inscritos, cada semana se jugaria a 2 juegos: 4 a uno y los 4 al otro). Y había pensado en que este 7 wonders podría ser uno de los elegidos. ¿Tú qué opinas Iván? ¿Y qué otros juegos ves bien para jugarlos a 4-5? (la idea está por materializar, pero creemos que lo mejor serían partidas de 4). Un saludo!! Responder Miguel Angel Cabaleiro Fernandez dice: 29/04/2015 a las 10:49 Yo creo que habrá un poco de todo! El aventureros al tren podria encajar bien, al igual que el Catán y el 7 Wonders. Luego se meterá alguno como el Sushi Go, que se pueden jugar \"x\" partidas para que no sea demasiado corto, La Era del Carbón (que aún no lo jugué y estoy tentado de comprar)… Algo así 🙂 iMisut dice: 29/04/2015 a las 09:44 Es una buena elección, aunque como siempre, dependerá del nivel del grupo. Supongo que los juegos que plantearéis serán euros medios/familiares, que no se vayan de madre de duración y que la explicación no sea gran cosa. Con 4/5 jugadores, pues los siguientes me encajarían (además del 7 Wonders): – ¡Aventureros al Tren! – Airlines Europe (o Union Pacific) – Cualquiera del tandem Kramer/Kiesling: Asara, Torres, Tikal, Mexica, Java, La Era del Carbón, Los Palacios de Carrara, etc. La lista podría ser larga 😛 Miguel Cabaleiro dice: 12/05/2015 a las 09:54 Buenas Iván! Pues anoche pude jugar al 7 Wonders con el grupo de juego habitual y lo cierto es que me gustó un montón. Y a pesar de «debutar» con el juego, ya introducimos la expansión de «Leaders» (el amigo que lo tiene, tiene las 4 expansiones!!). No tuve mucha suerte con la maravilla que me tocó (Mausoleo de Halicarnaso, por la cara B), ya que sorteamos las maravillas y también el lugar que ocuparíamos en la mesa (todo mu profesional, jeje), pero hice una partida decente. Y éramos 5 a jugar, un número cojonudo para este juego por lo que se vio, aunque se podría jugar perfectamente a 6 y a 7, a no ser por el espacio que se necesita, que parece que no pero ocupa mucha mesa! Yo creo que los lunes, que es cuando nos reunimos, este juego va a ver mucha mesa ya que les chifla a mis colegas y a mi me gustó mucho también. Y seguro que la próxima vez tendré ocasión de probar alguna expansión más que ya comentaré. Un saludo!! iMisut dice: 12/05/2015 a las 09:56 ¡Buen comienzo! Hombre, 7 Wonders es un juego que también tiene su punto. Al final dependes bastante de tus vecinos y estos van a definir bastante tu forma de jugar, sobre todo por los recursos y por los conflictos. A mi me gusta mucho, aunque no hay que abusar de él. Saludos!!! YiyeruBatavio dice: 29/06/2017 a las 13:55 Cada día estoy más convencido de que estos juegos monomecánicos que pegan el pelotazo son para jugarlos muy preferiblemente con la copia de otro ya que aguantan un número muy limitado de partidas, no por la rejugabilidad que puedan soportar, sino porque al cabo de la tercera o cuarta partida ya no te quedan ganas de jugarlos… Me pasó con este (draft y punto) Me pasó con Dominion (deckbuilding a secas) Me pasó con Splendor (gestión de pereza…) Firmado: El señor rancio.

A mi de Antoine Bauza me esta llamando la atención el ghost stories, lo has jugado? me encantaría saber tu opinión sobre el. Responder iMisut dice: 16/01/2019 a las 21:56 No lo he jugado porque es colaborativo, y es un tipo de juego que no me gusta. Lo sientom Gonzalo dice: 16/03/2023 a las 00:44 Ghost Stories es en mi humilde opinión una maravilla mecánica y con mucho el mejor diseño del Sr. Bauza. Por cierto que ya lo estamos jugando en mi grupo en forma competitiva dos contra dos con un par de reglas caseras y nos funciona genial. Enrique dice: 28/05/2019 a las 23:41 Buenas Misut. Me podrías decir la medida de las cartas para enfudarlas por favor? Saludos Responder iMisut dice: 28/05/2019 a las 23:47 Son de 65×100 mm. Saludos!

Gran reseña y buenísimas fotos Responder Carlos dice: 14/06/2021 a las 18:07 Excelente reseña. Que opinas de la nueva edición? Hay algún cambio notable como para deshacerme del primero y adquirir la nueva edición? Responder Rubén dice: 09/11/2022 a las 12:09 Buenos días Iván, juego reseñado en 2013. Estamos finalizando 2022. Tantos años después… ¿qué juego o juegos recomendarías a un grupo de 4/5 jugadores que le encanta 7wonders y ya está quemado? Responder iMisut dice: 09/11/2022 a las 12:24 Asumo que queréis algo parecido. Habéis privado It’s a Wonderful World? Otra opción muy recomendable es Keyflow, que es una versión destilada de keyflower y que se consigue a muy buen precio en spiele offensive. Otra opción con draft de cartas con intercambio sería bunny kingdom o la isla de los gatos. Luis Suárez dice: 21/12/2022 a las 22:48 Que te parece 7wonders arquitects?

Sus efectos se detallan en la página 9. Cartas de Ciudad Las cartas de Ciudad, que son de color negro, son una nueva categoría de cartas. En cada partida se añaden algunas, de manera aleatoria, a los mazos de Era I, II y III. Cartas de Gremio y de Líder Los nuevos Gremios y Líderes se añaden a los ya disponibles. Nota algunas de estas cartas sólo se puede utilizar con esta expansión. Todas las cartas de esta expansión tienen impresa en la parte inferior una máscara, para poder separarlas fácilmente del resto del juego después de jugar.

Fichas de Diplomacia Las fichas de Diplomacia se utilizan para indicar el nuevo efecto de Diplomacia.

Ha retirado las cartas 7 de la partida. Luego, elige al azar 6 cartas de Ciudad de la Era I, 6 de la Era II y 6 de la Era III, y las añade a los mazos correspondientes. Además, añade 8 Gremios al mazo de Era III. - 4 - ',\n",
              "  'RESUMEN DE LA PARTIDA': 'Al inicio de cada Era, cada uno de los jugadores tendrá una mano de 8 cartas (en lugar de 7, como en el juego básico). En cada Era, los jugadores, por lo tanto, contarán con una carta extra. Las demás normas relativas al procedimiento de juego permanecen sin cambios. Los efectos de las nuevas cartas se detallan en las páginas siguientes. Sin embargo hay dos nuevas mecánicas que requieren de una explicación más detallada la deuda y la diplomacia. Deudas Una carta con el símbolo provoca una pérdida de monedas de todos los adversarios del jugador que ha puesto la carta en juego. Cada oponente deberá abonar el importe correspondiente a la banca, o deberá coger una ficha de Deuda por cada moneda que no haya pagado. Esto significa que puede haber deudas parciales, cuando un jugador paga, por un lado, una parte de la deuda en monedas y recibe, por otro lado, fichas de Deuda por el resto de monedas sin pagar. Al final de la partida, cada ficha de Deuda resta puntos de victoria (PV) al jugador que las posee. Aclaración - El jugador que pone en juego una carta de pérdida de dinero, no se ve afectado por dicha carta. - Las monedas perdidas por los jugadores van a parar a la banca. - Las deudas contraídas no puede ser canceladas. Importante las pérdidas de dinero se resuelven siempre al final de un turno, después de que los jugadores hayan jugado sus cartas, y por lo tanto, gastado sus monedas mercadeando, o por el contrario, ganado oro para pagar... Ejemplo César juega un Guarida (Lair). Cada jugador debe pagar 2 monedas al final del turno. David decide pagar las 2 monedas, que son entregadas a la banca. Alfonso tiene una sola moneda en sus arcas, pero decide pagar para obtener una sola ficha de Deuda. Mariano, por su parte, tiene monedas, pero decide guardarlas para más adelante; por lo tanto, recibe dos fichas de Deuda.

              "  'TRADUCCIÓN DE LAS CARTAS': '- 5 -Diplomacia Un jugador que pone en juego una carta con el símbolo recibe una ficha de Diplomacia de la banca, y la coloca en su tablero. JUEGO LIMPIO Lo adecuado es anunciar a tus oponentes que estás cogiendo una ficha de Diplomacia, a fin de evitar sorpresas en la próxima fase de Conflicto. Dicho jugador, no tomará parte en la resolución de la siguiente fase de Conflicto, tras la cual debe devolver la ficha de Diplomacia a la banca. El jugador se considera ausente durante la resolución de la fase, por lo que no recibirá ningún marcador de Conflicto (ni de victoria ni de derrota). Las ciudades vecinas a dicho jugador se considerarán adyacentes (para la fase de Conflicto de este turno solamente) y enfrentarán a sus milicias, de acuerdo a las normas habituales. Ejemplo Durante la Era I, Mariano juega una Residencia (Residence). Al final de esta Era, Mariano no tomará parte en la Resolución del Conflicto, por lo que sus dos vecinos, Alfonso y César, medirán sus fuerzas militares, como si sus ciudades fueran vecinas. Aclaraciones - U n jugador puede obtener varias fichas de Diplomacia, pero DEBE descartar una en cada fase de Resolución de Conflictos. - U n jugador con una ficha de Diplomacia está OBLIGADO a jugarla durante la siguiente fase de Reso - lución de Conflictos (incluso si ese jugador es militarmente más fuerte que los jugadores vecinos). Si solamente hay dos jugadores implicados en una fase de Resolución de Con - flictos, se enfrentan entre sí una sola vez, por lo que ganarán marcadores de Conflicto una sola vez. Ejemplo Durante la fase de Resolución de Conflictos de la Era II, César, Ainhoa, David y Andrés no participan (cada uno de ellos pierde una ficha de Diplomacia anteriormente adquirida). A Mariano no le quedan más fichas de Diplomacia, por lo que entra en guerra. Mariano y Alfonso comparan sus milicias, de acuerdo con las normas habituales. Mariano gana, pero solamente se lleva un marcador de Victoria, ya que solamente tenía un rival durante esta fase. ',\n",
              "  'FIN DE LA PARTIDA': 'Cada jugador suma sus puntos de victoria y los añade a los de su compañero de equipo. El equipo con la puntuación más alta, gana. ',\n",
              "  'DESCRIPCIÓN': 'de los Símbolos Cada jugador, excepto el que ha puesto esta carta en juego (o desarrollado el nivel de su Maravi - lla), debe pagar a la banca la cantidad de monedas indicada. Por cada moneda que el jugador quiera o no pueda pagar, recibirá una ficha de Deuda. El jugador recibe una ficha de Diplomacia. Al final de la Era, el jugador se deshace de la ficha y a cambio no toma parte en la fase de Resolución de Conflictos. La ciudad situada a la izquierda del jugador se tendrá que enfrentar por tanto a la situada a la derecha del jugador. Nota el efecto de las fichas de Diplomacia cambia cuando se trata de una partida por equipos. Al final de la partida, la máscara copia el símbolo científico de una carta verde presente en una de las dos ciudades vecinas. Cada turno, el jugador tiene un descuento comercial de una moneda en el primer recurso que él o ella compre en la ciudad vecina (de la izquierda o de la derecha, dependiendo del símbolo). Cada turno, esta carta produce un recurso, a elección del jugador, de los que su propia ciudad produce, a través de cartas de color marrón yo gris, o como un recurso inicial de su tablero. Cada turno, esta carta produce un recurso, a elección del jugador, de los que su ciudad no produce, a través de cartas de color marrón yo gris, o como un recurso inicial de su tablero. Cada jugador, excepto el que haya puesto esta carta en juego, debe pagar una moneda a la banca por cada marcador de Victoria en su poder. Cada jugador, excepto el que haya puesto esta carta en juego, debe pagar una moneda a la banca por cada nivel de su Maravilla que haya sido desarrollado. La carta proporciona 1 moneda por cada carta negra presente en la ciudad del jugador en el momento en el que se pone en juego (ésta incluida). Al final de la partida, además proporciona 1PV por cada carta negra en la ciudad del jugador (ésta incluida). La carta proporciona 1 moneda por marcador de Victoria presente en la ciudad del jugador en el momento en el que se pone en juego. Al final de la partida, además proporciona 1PV por cada marcador de Victoria presente en la ciudad del jugador. El jugador recibe 6 monedas de la banca. Los dos jugadores vecinos reciben de la banca 1 moneda. El jugador recibe 9 monedas de la banca. Los dos jugadores vecinos reciben de la banca 2 monedas. Desde el momento en el que esta carta entra en juego, el jugador puede desarrollar su mara - villa sin tener que pagar sus costes en recursos. La carta proporciona 1 PV por cada marcador de Victoria en las ciudades vecinas. LÍDERES Desde el momento en el que esta carta entra en juego, cada cantidad de monedas que se reciba de la banca se incrementa en 1. Este aumento se limita a una moneda por turno. El jugador puede construir una carta negra por Era de manera gratuita. Desde el momento en el que esta carta entra en juego, el jugador obtiene 2 monedas por cada carta negra que construya. Cada carta negra proporciona 1PV al final de la partida. Desde el momento en el que esta carta entra en juego, cada marcador de de - rrota cuenta como un Escudo en todas las fases de Resolución de Conflictos siguientes. ',\n",

Diplomacia - Si la Ciudad Libre pone una carta de Diplomacia en juego, no toma parte en la fase de Resolución de Conflictos correspondiente y los dos jugadores se enfrentarán entre sí una sola vez.

Prepara la partida como para un grupo de 7 jugadores (toda la Era I, la II y la III del juego básico, 9 Gremios y 7 cartas negras en cada mazo de Era). Al comienzo de cada Era, reparte 7 cartas a cada jugador. Cada jugador jugará 6, exactamente como en el juego básico.

Resumen de una Era Durante la partida, los compañeros de equipo pueden comunicarse libremente entre sí y mostrarse las cartas de sus manos (incluidas las cartas de Líder si estáis usando dicha expansión). Un jugador debe utilizar sus propios recursos antes de comprar uno a sus vecinos. Se prohíbe a los compañeros de equipo - Compartir monedas,- Cambiarse cartas, - El comercio gratuito entre ellos,- Comprarse recursos el uno al otro para poner en juego edificios que se pueden conseguir mediante una construcción en cadena. Cuando un jugador pone en juego una carta que provoca una pérdida de dinero, su compañero de equipo también tiene que pagar esa pérdida. En el juego por equipos, la fase de Resolución de Conflictos y la Diplomacia se juegan de forma distinta. Resolución de Conflictos por equipos. En el juego por equipos, no hay enfrentamientos entre dos jugadores de un mismo equipo. Por lo que cada jugador se enfrenta solamente a la ciudad enemiga adyacente a la suya. Nota durante la fase de Resolución de Conflictos, la cantidad de fichas dadas se duplica - Una victoria durante la Era I equivale a 2 marcadores de Victoria de 1PV.- Una victoria durante la Era II equivale a 2 marcadores de Victoria de 3PV.- Una victoria durante la Era III equivale a 2 marcadores de Victoria de 5PV.- Una derrota en cualquier Era equivale a 2 marcadores de Derrota de -1PV. - 11 -La diplomacia en el juego por equipos Un jugador que pone en juego una carta con el símbolo consigue una ficha de Diplomacia de la banca, que coloca en su tablero. Durante la siguiente fase de Conflicto, el jugador todavía participa en dicha fase, pero tanto su equipo, como los de sus oponentes sólo recibirán un marcador de Conflicto en lugar de dos. El uso de la ficha de Diplomacia es obligatorio, y una vez jugada, se desecha. Aclaraciones - El uso de una ficha de Diplomacia por un jugador no afecta a su compañero de equipo. - Es posible que un jugador gane un conflicto, incluso si el jugador ha jugado una ficha de Diplomacia. - Si los 2 miembros de un equipo han jugado una ficha de Diplomacia, cada uno de ellos recibe una sola ficha de Conflicto, así como sus oponentes. Ejemplo Alfonso y Mariano son compañeros de equipo. Durante la fase de Resolución de Conflic - tos de la Era III, Alfonso utiliza una ficha de Diplomacia. Pierde el conflicto (su oponente tiene una fuerza militar superior), por lo que coge un solo marcador de Derrota (-1PV) y su oponente un solo marcador de Victoria (5PV).

              " 'bgg': ['Originally posted as a video review with extended final thoughts on our Rolls in the Family YouTube channel Video Review Overview 7 Wonders is a card-drafting civilization game that will have you selecting cards over 3 ages to build your unique Wonder, invest in science and infrastructure, and war with your neighboring opponents. All turns are performed simultaneously, with each player selecting a card from their current hand to play, and then passing the remaining cards to the next player. Once all but the last card in each hand have been drafted, the Age ends and you compare your military power to the players on your left and right, distributing victory points based on the results. New hands are dealt at the beginning of each Age, and after 3 Ages the players will tally their final scores.',\n",
              "  'Game Feel Each time you select a card in 7 Wonders, you can decide to play it for its effect, use it to build a stage of your wonder, or discard it for 3 coins. Many cards require you to have the matching resources to play, so collecting resource production cards is important for having more playable options. However, you can also pay either of your neighbors two coins to use one of their resource icons, and some cards can also be played for free if you have the prerequisite card from the preceding Age. You are constantly faced with decisions like, Do I take this card that immediately benefits me, or take this other card that will give me the potential of stronger options later? If you can acquire a lot of money, you may be able to get away with fewer of your own resource cards. But be careful, if neither you nor your neighbors have a specific resource going into the late game, you may be locked out of playing any cards that require it. If you want to gain the powerful benefits from building your unique wonder, you know that, multiple times during the game, you will need to pass on the options in your hand to play a card face down. But when is the right time? Do you push your luck that a future hand will have worse options than your current hand? While most of what your opponents are doing does not affect you directly, the sharing of resources, military battles, and overall strategies of your two neighbors give you plenty of reasons to keep an eye on what they are doing and take those variables into account whenever you select a card. Especially with abilities like the green technology cards that can multiply to huge totals if a player collects a lot of them, you dont want to be the player that kept passing your neighbor the perfect cards for them to amass a ridiculous amount of points. FAQ',\n",
              "  'Player Counts - 7 Wonders plays well across a wide variety of player counts, mainly because of its use of simultaneous card drafting. There is a 2-player variant which we cant recommend directly, though some people seem to enjoy it. And if you pick up the Cities expansion, it pushes the game to 8 players which still works great. Abstract vs. Thematic - The asymmetric wonders and use of resources to build cards help to reinforce the civilization theme, but the theme definitely fades into the background as you start thinking about the card effects and which ones to keep. Luck vs. Skill - There is a nice balance of luck and skill here. While the hands of cards are randomized, your strategy is constantly informed by the cards that you and your opponents are playing. However, the card drafting causes the skill in the game to lean more towards repeated tactical decisions than long-term strategy. Multiplayer Solitaire vs. Highly Interactive - The core mechanisms dont sound particularly interactive as each player is working on their own tableau, but the strategies of others, and especially your neighbors, really have a lot of influence on how you approach your own decisions. Short Setup vs. Long Setup - It is a fairly easy game to set up, with the main chore being removing cards from the decks to configure them for your specific player count. But then you can just deal hands and get playing. Easy to Teach vs. Hard to Teach - While 7 Wonders is relatively easy to teach as far as strategy games go, we think it is trickier to teach well than it often gets credit for. Players need to understand all the card types and how resources and prerequisites work, and the hidden, simultaneous card drafting means that it is a little harder for experienced players to help out new players that may be confused by their options. Low Setup Variability vs. High Setup Variability - Each player getting a unique wonder and dealing unique hands gives this nice setup variability, though the deck for a player count will always be the same outside of some of the purple guild cards that are randomized in the Age 3 deck. Things to Like Every Turn Is an Interesting Decision - One of the great things about card drafting is you are constantly given a choice among several good options, and every time you receive a new hand from your neighbor, it is a new puzzle figuring out which of those cards serve you best. The interest of the decision is amplified by some cards helping now versus others, such as resources, investing in the future, as well as the fact that you want to make sure you arent passing the next player something too good. Almost No Downtime - The other great thing about card drafting is that turns are performed simultaneously, and you are rarely waiting long for the next interesting decision. This comes at the expense of some direct player interaction but is still a huge strength as it allows everyone at the table to have a satisfying strategic experience with a game length that remains short even with larger player counts. Great Ratio of Depth to Game Length - And it is really the combination of those interesting decisions and quick play time that give 7 Wonders an outstanding ratio of depth to game length. For a larger group that is still looking for a more strategic experience, 7 Wonders gives them great bang for their buck. Variety of Strategic Routes - And the game remains interesting after many plays, largely because there is a lot of room for your strategy to play out differently. There are some extreme strategies such as spamming blue point cards, green technologies, or dominating military battles, but there are also any number of hybrid strategies that could be victorious. If you want to play well, you really need to be willing to adapt to the cards you receive, the decisions your neighboring opponents make, and the opportunities afforded by your unique Wonder.',\n",
              "  'Things to Dislike Falls into Narrow Niche of Complexity - In our experience, 7 Wonders can fall into kind of a weird in-between category where it can have too much complexity for some less experienced gamers, but can also leave some gamers feeling like it isnt complex enough. As long as you have a group that all fall within those bounds they will likely have a great time, but for a game that can play all the way up to 7 players, the odds go up that at least one person in the group falls outside the target audience and it can make it a little harder to get to the table. Hate Drafting Can Feel Forced - And while keeping an eye on your opponent makes the tactical decisions more interesting, there are also times where you feel you have no choice but to block your opponent from an amazing card, and it can feel less fun giving up a turn to take something that may not be very good for you.',\n",

If you want your interaction to be a little more direct or prefer strategic planning over tactical decisions, 7 Wonders might not be the best choice. But if you want a strategy game that can support higher player counts while still playing quickly, enjoy figuring out the best card out of a hand of options, and like building up your own tableau of cards in front of you, 7 Wonder fits the bill and still holds up after over a decade.

              " 'misut': 'Saltar al contenido Reseña: 7 Wonders Escrito por iMisut 06/02/2013 21 Comentarios Introducción Hoy toca hablar de uno de los juegos que, desde que lo tengo, mas veces ha salido a la mesa. Se trata, nada mas y nada menos que de 7 Wonders, el aclamado y galardonado juego del diseñador francés Antoine Bauza, con las magnificas ilustraciones del también famoso Miguel Coimbra. Portada Entre los muchos galardones acumulados por este titulo, hay que destacar el Kennerspiel des Jahres (Juego del Año para Expertos) dentro de los Spiel des Jahres del 2011, es decir, que tiene suficientes credenciales como para ser un Must Have. ¿Que nos propone 7 Wonders? Pues nada mas y nada menos que ponernos al mando de una de las siete civilizaciones que contruyeron alguna de las siete maravillas del mundo antiguo: los Jardines Colgantes de Babilonia, el Coloso de Rodas, el Templo de Artemisa, el Mausoleo de Halicarnaso, el Faro de Alejandría y la Gran Pirámide de Guiza (la unica maravilla que se mantiene en pie hoy en día). Desde nuestro puesto iremos tomando decisiones que nos hagan prosperar lo suficiente como para construir esa maravilla por la cual nuestra civilización será recordada en los libros de historia. Contraportada Se encuentra publicado en España de la mano de Asmodee (que como es habitual, realiza una localización justita, traduciendo únicamente las normas, dejando las cartas con los nombres en inglés). Es un juego de 2 a 7 personas (gran abanico de posibilidades), con una duración media por partida de una media hora. Importante: si ya conoces el juego y/o sólo te interesa mi opinión sobre el mismo, puedes pasar directamente al apartado de Opinión. Los apartados Contenido y Mecánica están destinados especialmente a aquellos que no conocen el juego y prefieren hacerse una idea general de cómo funciona. Ir a la Opinión Personal Contenido El juego viene en una caja de tamaño estándar de juegos de mesa, con unas dimensiones de 30 cm x 30 cm x 7,5 cm (medidas muy similares a las de cajas de otros juegos como Dominion o Juego de Tronos) con un peso aproximado de unos 900 gr. (lo que nos da una idea de que mucho material no viene dentro de semejante cajaza). El contenido es el siguiente: 7 tableros de Civilización (cartón) 7 cartas Maravilla 49 cartas Era I 49 cartas Era II 49 cartas Era III 42 marcadores de Conflicto (cartón) 20 monedas de valor 3 (cartón) 30 monedas de valor 1 (cartón) 1 libreta para las puntuaciones 1 libro de reglas 2 cartas especiales para el modo “2 jugadores” Contenido Mecánica El concepto de 7 Wonders es muy sencillo a la vez que interesante. Vayamos por partes, primero explicaré el juego de 3 a 7 jugadores, y, posteriormente, comentaré que modificaciones se realizan para poder jugar 2 jugadores. Conceptos Básicos Hablemos de los conceptos básicos. En primer lugar tenemos las Cartas de, que simbolizan las posibles construcciones que podremos levantar en nuestra civilización. Hay 7 tipos de construcciones, que a la postre darán todas puntos de victoria de alguna manera: Cartas de Recursos Naturales (Marrones) Cartas de Recursos Elaborados (Grises) Cartas de Construcciones Científicas (Verdes) Cartas de Construcciones Económicas (Amarillas) Cartas de Construcciones Bélicas (Rojas) Cartas de Construcciones Ornamentales (Azules) Cartas de Construcciones de Gremios (Moradas) En el borde superior izquierdo de la carta se indica el coste de construcción, o bien la construcción de la Era anterior que se debe tener para construir dicho elemento sin necesidad de cumplir los requisitos de coste. En nuestro tablero de civilización tendremos dibujada la gran maravilla que aspiramos a construir. Esta tendrá varias fases de construcción, con un coste indicado, que deberemos cumplir para construir dicha fase. Como habréis comprobado, la manera de conseguir recursos es levantando las edificaciones que nos los proporcionen en cada turno. Pero es posible que no tengamos suficientes unidades de determinados elementos a la hora de querer construir un determinado edificio. Esto se soluciona con el comercio con nuestros vecinos (los jugadores adyacentes). En cualquier turno podremos hacer uso de los recursos que generen las civilizaciones vecinas, pagando un coste. Este será, salvo que tengamos algún edificio que diga lo contrario, de dos monedas por unidad de recurso que utilicemos. Nuestros vecinos no podrán negarse a dárnoslos. Monedas Y para finalizar, tendremos los conflictos bélicos que ocurren al final de cada Era. Estos suceden con tus vecinos. Para ello se comparan el numero de escudos que se tienen en los edificios bélicos construidos (los rojos). El que mas escudos tenga gana el conflicto, llevándose los puntos de victoria correspondientes (1 por victoria en la primera era, 3 en la segunda y 5 en la tercera). En el mejor de los casos, por conflictos bélicos se aspira a tener 18 puntos (ganar los 2 conflictos de cada era). Para que seáis capaces de vislumbrar las posibilidades estratégicas del juego: Las construcciones ornamentales (azules) otorgan los puntos de victoria que se indican en la carta Las construcciones científicas (verdes) otorgan puntos según su combinación. Existen 3 símbolos (tablilla de piedra, rueda dentada y compás con regla). Las cartas de cada símbolo da puntos por si solas, otorgando el numero de cartas de cada símbolo al cuadrado (es decir, si tenemos 1 carta de rueda dentada, nos dará 1 punto, si tenemos 2, 4 puntos, si tenemos 3, 9 puntos, etc.). Así con cada uno de los 3 símbolos. Además, cada tripleta de construcciones científicas que tengamos (3 cartas verdes, una con cada uno de los símbolos) nos otorgará 7 puntos. Algunas construcciones económicas (amarillas) dan puntos de victoria (por cada nivel de maravilla construido, por número de construcciones económicas, etc.). También las monedas que nos hayan quedado en tesorería dan puntos (1 punto por cada 3 monedas). Y finalmente las construcciones de gremios (moradas) dan puntos según la condición que indiquen, que normalmente estará relacionada con alguno de los tipos de construcciones disponibles y relacionada con nosotros y nuestros vecinos. Preparación de la Partida En primer lugar, hay que dejar en la caja las cartas que no correspondan al número de jugadores que haya en la partida. A continuación: Se ajusta el numero de cartas necesarios para jugar (en función del numero de jugadores hay mas o menos cartas de era), se barajan y se colocan en 3 mazos. Cada jugador elige una civilización (aquí como cada uno quiera repartirlas, al azar o eligiendo cada uno una) y se decide por que cara del tablero se juega (la cara B es algo mas complicada que la A, pero no modifica la mecánica de juego en absoluto). Se entrega a cada jugador 3 monedas de valor 1. Existe una variante para poder jugar a 2. Se utiliza una civilización neutral, que será controlada alternativamente por cada uno de los dos jugadores, de manera que pueda ir levantando construcciones que puedan interesar a los dos. Desarrollo de la Partida El juego consta de 3 eras. En cada una de las eras se reparten todas las cartas (7 para cada jugador) y comienza el juego. En cada turno, el jugador deberá elegir una carta de su mano para realizar una de las siguientes acciones: Construir dicha carta, cumpliendo la condiciones indicadas en el borde superior izquierdo (como he comentado antes) Construir una parte de la maravilla, usando la carta bocabajo, y pagando el coste indicado en el nivel de la maravilla (vale cualquier carta que tengamos en nuestra mano) Descartar la carta y ganar 3 monedas En el momento de levantar una construcción, puede darse el caso de que no contemos con los recursos necesarios. Es aquí donde aparece el comercio con nuestros vecinos. Y es que podremos comprar los recursos necesarios a estos (y no podrán negarse) pagando 2 monedas por cada unidad que necesitemos (si no tenemos una construcción que modifique este precio), siempre y cuando ellos cuenten con dicho material. Una vez realizada la acción con nuestra carta, pasamos nuestra mano a uno de los jugadores adyacentes (en función de las Eras se rotan las manos en sentido horario o antihorario, viene indicado en el anverso de las cartas). Se van jugando cartas hasta que solo queden manos de 2 cartas, que será el ultimo turno de esa Era. Cuando solo queden 2 cartas, cada jugador elegirá una para realizar su acción y la otra la colocará en la pila de descartes. Y con esto finaliza una era. Solo falta resolver los conflictos y entregar los puntos de victoria correspondientes a cada jugador. Marcadores de Conflicto Fin de la Partida La partida finaliza cuando se jueguen todas las rondas de cada una de las tres eras. Tras eso, realizaremos el recuento final y el ganador será el jugador con mas puntos de victoria. Opinión Personal Nos encontramos ante el Filler (para algunos) del 2011 y que verdaderamente hizo furor. Es una idea magnifica porque coge un concepto bastante común en este tipo de juegos, como es el de tener una mano de posibles construcciones e ir levantándolas en nuestra civilización según convenga, con el de que dicho mano vaya rotando por todos los jugadores, pues es aquí donde aparece la gran novedad estratégica que ofrece 7 Wonders. Por otro lado es un juego que «nos aisla» del resto de jugadores. Es decir, seamos el número de jugadores que seamos, principalmente tendremos que estar pendiente de los dos jugadores adyacentes a nosotros, a nuestra izquierda y a nuestra derecha, pues es con ellos con quienes interactuaremos a lo largo de la partida, negociando y guerreando al final de cada Era. Además, habrá muchas cartas que nos otorgarán privilegios en función de la evolución de nuestros vecinos. Del resto de jugadores habrá que estar pendientes básicamente para ir controlando qué cartas construyen que nos interesaban a nosotros y dejen de estar disponibles en las futuras manos que nos irán llegando. Tableros de Maravilla La separación de las Eras no es casual. Cada Era debe servir para una cosa. La primera Era es claramente de levantamiento de construcciones que den recursos que a la postre nos permitan edificar construcciones mas poderosas. Un buen baremo para guiarnos en esta primera Era es asegurarnos los recursos que nos permitan construir nuestra maravilla. La tercera Era será la de las grandes construcciones (de gran coste de recursos en cantidad y diversidad). La segunda Era es algo intermedio entre la primera y la segunda. También comentar que completar la maravilla no es condición indispensable para ganar la partida, aunque si otorga muchísimos puntos en el recuento final. Pero hay maravillas que otorgan privilegios, que, en función de la estrategia que hayamos decidido tomar, puede que no nos interese completar. Según mi experiencia, el número mínimo ideal para jugar a 7 Wonders es 4 jugadores, pues con 4 jugadores ya hay aislamiento, es decir, hay jugadores que no están adyacentes entre si, provocando que haya recursos que no estén accesibles a todos, que es uno de los grandes problemas al que se enfrentan los jugadores en 7 Wonders, que no es otro que planificar que recursos interesa que tengamos nosotros en nuestra civilización y cuales «esperamos» que vayan a tener los demás. Obviamente, gastar un turno en levantar una construcción que nos proporcione recursos duele un poco, pues parece que no estamos obteniendo nada que a la postre nos dé puntos de victoria. Pero a medida que la partida avance, sobre todo si son recursos que solo tenemos nosotros, serán una fuente de ingresos gracias al comercio con nuestros vecinos, que necesitarán ese preciado recurso que solo tenemos nosotros. Además, también es muy interesante ver como ocurren reacciones en cadena. Esto ocurre normalmente con las construcciones bélicas. En el momento que un jugador construye su primera construcción bélica… salta la liebre. Los jugadores adyacente intentarán construir para defenderse, lo que provocará que los adyacentes a estos también intenten defenderse. Cartas de Era Existe cierto componente de fastidio a los rivales (además de los conflictos bélicos) pues, como para levantar las distintas fases de nuestra maravilla o conseguir monedas mediante el descarte no importa que carta usemos, los jugadores intentarán sacar de la partida construcciones que beneficien al resto de jugadores pero que a nosotros no nos aporten gran cosa. Es un juego donde es indispensable la capacidad de adaptación y estar pendiente de lo que hacen los demás para utilizarlo en beneficio propio. De nada sirve centrarse en la propia civilización, pues seguramente el resto de jugadores se encargarán de evitar que prosperemos si nuestros planes son claros como el agua. Los materiales están bastante bien. El cartón de los tableros y los marcadores es de un grosor suficiente como para que el juego soporte el paso del tiempo sin muchos problemas. Las cartas son ENORMES, lo que permiten admirar en todo su esplendor las ilustraciones de Miguel Coimbra. Pero como siempre, la perfección no existe. ¿Cuales son los lunares de este, por otro lado, juegazo? Como he dicho al principio, en mi opinión no deja de ser un Filler. Uno de los mejores Fillers que he jugado. Pero un Filler a fin de cuentas. Una vez que los jugadores saben jugar, las partidas duran lo que se indica en la caja, en torno a la media hora. Y aunque el juego permita multitud de posibilidades tácticas, las decisiones que se van tomando a lo largo de la partida suelen ser similares en todas, por lo que el juego se quema bastante rápido y vuelve a tardar en salir. Tipos de Cartas Además, es un juego de cartas (con algunos marcadores de cartón y los tableros) por el que hay que desembolsar casi 35 € (mas el desembolso en las fundas para proteger las cartas), por lo que en mi opinión, es un juego caro, sobre todo teniendo en cuenta eso, que es posible quemarlo bastante rápido y que tarde en volver a salir a la mesa. Pero no deja de ser un señor juego que no debería faltar en ninguna ludoteca. Por todo esto le doy un… Me gusta esto: Cargando...

SIGUIENTE Partida: Agricola (11/02/2013) 21 comentarios Neiban dice: 07/02/2013 a las 00:29 Buenas Iván. No conocía tu blog, así que te añado a mi blogroll. Buena reseña del 7Wonder. Es cierto que jugándose mucho se puede quemar bastante, pero… ¿no le pasa esto a casi todo filler? Saludos! Responder iMisut dice: 07/02/2013 a las 07:34 Como bien dices, todo Filler es susceptible de quemarse saliendo mucho a la mesa. Pero al 7 Wonders ademas le noto que aun es mas fácil quemarlo. Yo siento que acabas jugando muy parecido todas las partidas. Hay pocas opciones de variación. Responder Javier Torres dice: 03/02/2014 a las 09:18 Gran reseña. Yo solo puedo jugar con mi hija y mi mujer, y aunque sea a 3, nos gusta bastante, pero es lo que dices; se esta empezando a quemar. Crees que con las expansiones ganará el juego en algo y será menos monótono? Enhorabuena por el blog y por tus aportaciones en AP Podcast. Un saludo. Responder iMisut dice: 03/02/2014 a las 09:29 Buenas Javier! Ante todo gracias por pasarte y por la enhorabuena. Hombre, ante todo decirte que yo no tengo ninguna de las dos expansiones. Ambas valen aproximadamente lo mismo (casi 20 €). Por ese precio puedes casi comprarte un juego nuevo, de lo que yo soy partidario antes de expandir uno que ya se tiene. Pero segun he leido, la expansión mas interesante es la segunda, Cities. Es la que añade mas conceptos y mas variedad al juego. La de Leaders es prescindible. Ya te digo, segun lo que he leido. Así que mi consejo: si te vas a comprar un juego nuevo, por el mismo precio puedes pillarte el Santiago de Cuba y tienes algo distinto. Si estás decidido a ampliar el 7 Wonders, pues Cities. Un saludo! Miguel Angel Cabaleiro Fernandez dice: 29/04/2015 a las 08:46 Buenas Iván: Pues yo la verdad es que le tengo muchas ganas a este juego. Gran parte de mis amigos juegan al 7 wonders y próximamente vamos a organizar una liguilla con emparejamientos semanales, con la premisa de que cada semana se juegue a un juego diferente (en plan, si somos 8 los inscritos, cada semana se jugaria a 2 juegos: 4 a uno y los 4 al otro). Y había pensado en que este 7 wonders podría ser uno de los elegidos. ¿Tú qué opinas Iván? ¿Y qué otros juegos ves bien para jugarlos a 4-5? (la idea está por materializar, pero creemos que lo mejor serían partidas de 4). Un saludo!! Responder Miguel Angel Cabaleiro Fernandez dice: 29/04/2015 a las 10:49 Yo creo que habrá un poco de todo! El aventureros al tren podria encajar bien, al igual que el Catán y el 7 Wonders. Luego se meterá alguno como el Sushi Go, que se pueden jugar \"x\" partidas para que no sea demasiado corto, La Era del Carbón (que aún no lo jugué y estoy tentado de comprar)… Algo así 🙂 iMisut dice: 29/04/2015 a las 09:44 Es una buena elección, aunque como siempre, dependerá del nivel del grupo. Supongo que los juegos que plantearéis serán euros medios/familiares, que no se vayan de madre de duración y que la explicación no sea gran cosa. Con 4/5 jugadores, pues los siguientes me encajarían (además del 7 Wonders): – ¡Aventureros al Tren! – Airlines Europe (o Union Pacific) – Cualquiera del tandem Kramer/Kiesling: Asara, Torres, Tikal, Mexica, Java, La Era del Carbón, Los Palacios de Carrara, etc. La lista podría ser larga 😛 Miguel Cabaleiro dice: 12/05/2015 a las 09:54 Buenas Iván! Pues anoche pude jugar al 7 Wonders con el grupo de juego habitual y lo cierto es que me gustó un montón. Y a pesar de «debutar» con el juego, ya introducimos la expansión de «Leaders» (el amigo que lo tiene, tiene las 4 expansiones!!). No tuve mucha suerte con la maravilla que me tocó (Mausoleo de Halicarnaso, por la cara B), ya que sorteamos las maravillas y también el lugar que ocuparíamos en la mesa (todo mu profesional, jeje), pero hice una partida decente. Y éramos 5 a jugar, un número cojonudo para este juego por lo que se vio, aunque se podría jugar perfectamente a 6 y a 7, a no ser por el espacio que se necesita, que parece que no pero ocupa mucha mesa! Yo creo que los lunes, que es cuando nos reunimos, este juego va a ver mucha mesa ya que les chifla a mis colegas y a mi me gustó mucho también. Y seguro que la próxima vez tendré ocasión de probar alguna expansión más que ya comentaré. Un saludo!! iMisut dice: 12/05/2015 a las 09:56 ¡Buen comienzo! Hombre, 7 Wonders es un juego que también tiene su punto. Al final dependes bastante de tus vecinos y estos van a definir bastante tu forma de jugar, sobre todo por los recursos y por los conflictos. A mi me gusta mucho, aunque no hay que abusar de él. Saludos!!! YiyeruBatavio dice: 29/06/2017 a las 13:55 Cada día estoy más convencido de que estos juegos monomecánicos que pegan el pelotazo son para jugarlos muy preferiblemente con la copia de otro ya que aguantan un número muy limitado de partidas, no por la rejugabilidad que puedan soportar, sino porque al cabo de la tercera o cuarta partida ya no te quedan ganas de jugarlos… Me pasó con este (draft y punto) Me pasó con Dominion (deckbuilding a secas) Me pasó con Splendor (gestión de pereza…) Firmado: El señor rancio. Responder Onimaru dice: 16/01/2019 a las 20:47 De verdad que eres un maestro de las reseñas, desde que conocí tu pagina tomo mejores decisiones a la hora de comprar juegos :). A mi de Antoine Bauza me esta llamando la atención el ghost stories, lo has jugado? me encantaría saber tu opinión sobre el. Responder iMisut dice: 16/01/2019 a las 21:56 No lo he jugado porque es colaborativo, y es un tipo de juego que no me gusta. Lo sientom Gonzalo dice: 16/03/2023 a las 00:44 Ghost Stories es en mi humilde opinión una maravilla mecánica y con mucho el mejor diseño del Sr. Bauza. Por cierto que ya lo estamos jugando en mi grupo en forma competitiva dos contra dos con un par de reglas caseras y nos funciona genial. Enrique dice: 28/05/2019 a las 23:41 Buenas Misut. Me podrías decir la medida de las cartas para enfudarlas por favor? Saludos Responder iMisut dice: 28/05/2019 a las 23:47 Son de 65×100 mm. Saludos! Tiratu dice: 02/12/2019 a las 21:09 Sin duda alguna, uno de los mejores juegos para más de 4 jugadores. Puedes jugar con 6 personas sin que el tiempo se exceda más y lo mejor de todo, sin AP. Gran reseña y buenísimas fotos Responder Carlos dice: 14/06/2021 a las 18:07 Excelente reseña. Que opinas de la nueva edición? Hay algún cambio notable como para deshacerme del primero y adquirir la nueva edición? Responder Rubén dice: 09/11/2022 a las 12:09 Buenos días Iván, juego reseñado en 2013. Estamos finalizando 2022. Tantos años después… ¿qué juego o juegos recomendarías a un grupo de 4/5 jugadores que le encanta 7wonders y ya está quemado? Responder iMisut dice: 09/11/2022 a las 12:24 Asumo que queréis algo parecido. Habéis privado It’s a Wonderful World? Otra opción muy recomendable es Keyflow, que es una versión destilada de keyflower y que se consigue a muy buen precio en spiele offensive. Otra opción con draft de cartas con intercambio sería bunny kingdom o la isla de los gatos. Luis Suárez dice: 21/12/2022 a las 22:48 Que te parece 7wonders arquitects? Responder iMisut dice: 22/12/2022 a las 00:38 No he podido probarlo, así que no te puedo decir. Lo siento. Deja una respuesta Tu dirección de correo electrónico no será publicada.
